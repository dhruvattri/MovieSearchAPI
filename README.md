    Dhruv Dhruv â€“ Client-Side JavaScript 03  
    Movie Search App using OMDb API + YouTube APIs

</div>

**For this Assignment, I developed a responsive movie search web application by integrating two well-documented APIs:
the OMDb API and the YouTube Data API v3.
The application allows users to search for movies by title, view corresponding posters and detailed metadata
and watch trailers retrieved from YouTube.
I used the fetch() API in JavaScript to retrieve JSON data from both APIs, parsed the responses
and dynamically injected content into the DOM to render movie details search results and embedded trailers.
I followed all assignment instructions and used API keys and adhered to official documentation
and expands upon the basic usage examples provided.
The project features a persistent dark mode using toggle(), a unified header and footer across all pages,
responsive layout and additional enhancements such as poster fallbacks, loading indicators and Enter (key) search functionality.
maintained clean, well-commented code throughout and documented my development progress through frequent and descriptive commits in a remote GitHub repository.
